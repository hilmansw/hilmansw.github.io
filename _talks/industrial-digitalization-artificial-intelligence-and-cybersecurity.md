I had the opportunity to be a speaker at a national seminar organized by the Student Executive Board (BEM) of the Faculty of Engineering, Wahid Hasyim University, with a seminar titled “Multidisciplinary Synergy in Advancing the Modern Industrial Revolution.”<br/>
<br/>
At the seminar, I explained how industries will massively use Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology as a major contributing factor in digital transformation in all sectors, including healthcare, education, energy, and cybersecurity.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, in the future, AI must remain under our control so that it continues to be based on ethical use and avoids irresponsible actions.<br/>
