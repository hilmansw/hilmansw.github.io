I had the opportunity to be a speaker at a data science workshop organized by Dunia Coding, which used a machine learning approach.<br/>
<br/>
At the workshop, I explained how to create a machine learning algorithm, optimize the model using specific hyperparameter tuning, evaluate the built model, and deploy the model using a Streamlit-based website so that it can be used directly to perform inferencing on input provided by users.
