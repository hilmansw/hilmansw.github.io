Abstract:
The advancement of information technology in today’s digital age takes place very rapidly from one time to another. This phenomenon is accompanied by increasing cybersecurity threats like phishing. Phishing links are often designed with uniform resource locator (URL) structures that appear convincing and are difficult to distinguish from genuine links. This research proposes a word-to-vector (Word2Vec) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach with hyperparameter tuning where Word2Vec is a word embedding technique used to create a word vector representation of a particular URL, SVM is used as a machine learning (ML) approach used in this research, and hyperparameter tuning is used as a technique to find the best combination of parameters to produce an optimal SVM model in detecting phishing. The purpose of this research is to compare the performance between SVM and XGBoost models that have been optimized and deploy ML models into a prediction system using the Streamlit framework to detect phishing based on input made by users in the form of certain URLs. The findings of this study indicated that the SVM model performed very well compared to the XGBoost model, with precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy values of about 99.84% for SVM. On the other hand, the XGBoost model recorded precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy values of about 99.70% each. Thus, the SVM model is the optimal model to detect phishing precisely and accurately.
